# Yet Another Fancy Box
This fancy box uses React to create a grid of divs that change color as you mouse over them. It's like magic, for your browser! 

On mouseover, boxes change color and gain an inset drop shadow, and on mouseout lose the shadow but retain their new, fancier color. 

Please enjoy!
